# Proposed Outreach Targets for Fenrix v0.0.1 Launch

This document lists the proposed websites, communities, and news outlets for promoting the initial release of Fenrix. User approval is requested before proceeding with content creation for these targets.

### Tier 1: Core Communities & News Aggregators

These are high-traffic platforms where developers discover new technologies.

1.  **Hacker News:**
    - **Rationale:** The primary hub for tech news and project launches. A successful post here can generate significant traffic and attract early adopters. The audience is highly technical and appreciates deep dives.
2.  **/r/rust (Reddit):**
    - **Rationale:** The official and largest community for Rust developers. This is the most important audience to reach. An announcement here is essential for community engagement and feedback.
3.  **Lobste.rs:**
    - **Rationale:** A technically-focused community similar to Hacker News, with a strong user base interested in systems programming and new technologies.

### Tier 2: Rust Ecosystem Channels

These are channels specifically focused on the Rust language and its ecosystem.

4.  **This Week in Rust (Newsletter):**
    - **Rationale:** A highly respected and widely read weekly newsletter. Being featured in the "New Crates" or "Project" section would provide direct exposure to the most engaged members of the Rust community.
5.  **Are We Web Yet (Newsletter/Site):**
    - **Rationale:** A project that specifically tracks the maturity of Rust for web development. Fenrix is directly relevant to their mission and audience.

### Tier 3: Developer Blogging & News Platforms

These platforms reach a broad audience of developers who may not be exclusively focused on Rust but are interested in new frameworks and technologies.

6.  **Dev.to:**
    - **Rationale:** A large and inclusive blogging platform. A well-written post can reach a wide audience of web developers and introduce them to the benefits of Rust and Fenrix.
7.  **The New Stack:**
    - **Rationale:** A tech news site that covers modern architectures, WebAssembly, and high-performance computing. Fenrix aligns well with their editorial focus.
8.  **LogRocket Blog:**
    - **Rationale:** This blog is known for its in-depth technical tutorials and deep dives into new frameworks. It's an excellent target for a version of our technical article.
9.  **Smashing Magazine:**
    - **Rationale:** A premier publication for web designers and developers. While heavily focused on the JavaScript ecosystem, they are influential and have published articles on WebAssembly and performance, making them a good target for a high-level introductory piece.
10. **/r/programming (Reddit):**
    - **Rationale:** A very large, general programming community. A post here can drive broad awareness of the project outside of the immediate Rust bubble.
