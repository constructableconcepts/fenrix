# Introduction

Welcome to Fenrix!

**Fenrix** is a full-fledged, Rust-centric web framework for building modern, performant, and dynamic web applications. Written entirely in Rust, it is designed to provide a highly ergonomic and productive development experience without sacrificing the raw performance and safety guarantees of the Rust language.

Inspired by the best ideas from established frameworks like Angular and React, and built upon the latest innovations in the Rust ecosystem, Fenrix aims to be the go-to choice for developers who want to build next-generation web apps with Rust.

## Why Fenrix?

Fenrix is built on a set of core principles that make it a powerful and enjoyable tool for web development:

- **Performance:** By leveraging Rust's zero-cost abstractions and a fine-grained reactivity model, Fenrix applications are fast by default.
- **Ergonomics:** With features like the `rsx!` macro and a simple component model, Fenrix is designed to be intuitive and easy to use.
- **Safety:** Rust's compile-time checks ensure that your application is free from common bugs, leading to more reliable and maintainable code.

This documentation will guide you through the process of building your first Fenrix application, from installation to deployment. Let's get started!
